Old Delhi (North Delhi) is known as the historical center, while New Delhi (South Delhi) is the capital city. But don’t be fooled! New Delhi is not without its own amazing sights. It is home to the Rashtrapati Bhavan or the Presidential Residence, a massive building with 340 rooms and around 190 acres of gardens – it is a must-see. But that is far from the end. Delhi is also home to many other monuments. The 73-meter-high Qutub Minar (built in 1193!) is hard to ignore. Humayun’s Tomb – a UNESCO Heritage Site – is a grand mausoleum built in 1570.",

The history contained within its walls is intriguing. The next destination on our trip is Agra, home to the amazing Taj Mahal, situated on the banks of the sacred Yamuna River! This 17th-century mausoleum is an imposing figure – made entirely of white marble and has an uncanny symmetry in its architecture.",

It is the home of the royal family of Jaipur, where the current Maharaja still resides! The public parts of this palace have an incredible display of traditional clothing, carpets, paintings, weapons and armor used and owned by generations of the royal family. A true walking history indeed. Right next to the palace grounds is the UNESCO recognized Jantar Mantar. It was an observatory built in the 1700s to study space. The original set of instruments at Jantar Mantar is well preserved, and on display for the public, the most important of which is perhaps the world’s largest sundial.",
